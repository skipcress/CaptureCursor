# CaptureCursor
A MacOS application intended to be run in conjunction with ProPresenter, which will restore the cursor to the center of the screen if the user moves the cursor to one of the display screens.

To install:
1. Download the file "Install_CaptureCursor.sh" to your Downloads directory
2. Open a terminal instance. To do this, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Space, type the word "Temrinal" and hit Enter
3. Copy the following command and paste it into your terminal window, hit Enter, and enter the password to your computer when prompted (you will not see your password as you type it, this is normal):<br/>sudo chmod +x ~/Downloads/Install_CaptureCursor.sh
4. Copy the following command and paste it into your teminal window, hit Enter, and follow the prompts:<br/>~/Downloads/Install_CaptureCursor.sh

Currently only supported on MacOS. The installation script has yet to be tested, so there are bound to be bugs. Feel free to let me know what you run into, but I will likely fix them anyway as I have an opportunity to test it.

Once CaptureCursor is installed, you can find it by launching Launchpad, just like most other applications. You can also pin it to your Dock.
